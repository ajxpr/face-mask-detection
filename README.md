# Face Mask Detection

This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people, with masks, without masks and incorrectly placed masks. Manually built and pretrained networks will be used to perform this classification task.

- Outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has created various changes in the lifestyle of everyone around the world.
- Among these changes, wearing a mask has been very vital to every individual.
- Detection of people who are not wearing masks is a challenge due to the large populations.
- This face mask detection project can be used in schools, hospitals, banks, airports etc as a digitalized scanning tool.
- The technique of detecting peopleâ€™s faces and segregating them into three classes namely the people with masks and people without masks and partial masks is done with the help of image processing and deep learning.
- With the help of this project, a person who is monitoring the face mask status for a particular firm can be seated in a remote area and still monitor efficiently and give instructions accordingly.
